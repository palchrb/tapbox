"""Gate the spotify song picker (fork v0.1.2 GET /context/tracks).

Hold-Y in now-playing lists a playing playlist's songs — same picker as
podcasts — and picking one starts it via /play {id, episode:<track uri>}
-> player.py --episode -> /player/play {uri, skip_to_uri}. Contract:

- expand_target(tracks=True) maps the fork's listing to episode rows
  (id/url = track uri, title = "name — artists", image = cover url);
  sweep-pending entries (track: null) are skipped, not rendered blank.
- tracks stays OPT-IN: without it a spotify entry expands to the same
  leaf card as before — a browse tap must PLAY, never open a list.
- albums list too (v0.1.2); a non-listable uri (HTTP 400) and a
  pre-v0.1.2 fork (404) degrade to the leaf card, no crash.
- v0.1.7: the endpoint answers WITHOUT waiting on the network, so the
  first call for an unknown context is ready=false + empty. The
  wrapper polls until the listing is renderable — rendered straight it
  opened the picker on nothing.
- play_spotify(start_uri=...) plays {uri, skip_to_uri=<pick>} from the
  top: no position, and the bookmark is neither read nor cleared."""
