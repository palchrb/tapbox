"""Gate the spotify control path. Two eras of contract, both enforced:

Old scars (field 2026-07-18 15:43-15:44): a /next whose status probe
timed out fell through to the replay fallback and RESTARTED the album
from 0:00, and queued slow controls fired late and out of order. Those
protections live on in the LOCKED path (playpause + the fast-path
fallback): an unreachable-but-running go-librespot never replays; only
playpause (or a STABLY empty session) replays.

New contract (go-librespot v0.0.8 fast-skip): next/prev on a live
spotify session are forwarded IMMEDIATELY (no busy-drop, no lock held
across the HTTP round) so the fork's debounce sees the true press
cadence — the old busy-gate spaced presses ~1s apart, each a fresh full
load, which defeated the debounce and re-created the 429 storm (field
2026-07-23 21:52: 10 loads in 9s from a prev mash). A FAILING fast-path
(dead session / unreachable api) falls back to the locked path, where
all the old guards still decide."""
