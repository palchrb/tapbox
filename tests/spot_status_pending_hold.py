"""Gate the mid-burst status card (field 2026-07-23 22:16, mash test):
during a v0.0.8 debounced skip the fork's /status answers with
pending_track_uri and NO track for a beat. That trackless-but-non-empty
answer skipped the hold-cache branch (which only fired on a fully empty
response) and flashed 'Nothing playing' on the screen mid-mash.

Contract: a trackless /status WITH an in-flight signal (pending skip,
busy marker, recent slow control) holds the last good card for the load
window — and still passes pending_track_uri through. A trackless answer
with NO signal keeps the old behavior (a deliberate stop shows
immediately)."""
